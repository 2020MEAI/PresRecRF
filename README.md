This repository contains source code and datasets for "[PresRecRF: Herbal prescription recommendation via the representation fusion of large TCM semantics and molecular knowledge](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2024.156116)". 

In this study, we proposed a novel herbal **Pres**cription **Rec**ommendation model with the **R**epresentation **F**usion of large TCM semantics and molecular knowledge (termed PresRecRF, See Fig1 below). 
The entire process of the proposed PresRecRF model closely mirrors the actual diagnosis and treatment procedures carried out by doctors, which are better applied in real clinical scenarios.
